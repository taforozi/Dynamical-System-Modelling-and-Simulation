# Dynamical-System-Modelling-and-Simulation
This assignment was part of the course _Dynamical System Modelling and Simulation_ and it consists of three parts which are described below.

## Part 1
The first part refers to **linear parameterization** and **unknown parameter estimation** using off-line parameter estimation techniques. Especially, using the offline version of the **Least Squares Method**, which is based on the minimization of estimation error criteria, we are trying to estimate the real values of the unknown parameters in two cases of systems. To use this method we have to guarantee that the parameters appear in a linear form. The systems we face are a mass - spring - damper system and an RLC circuit.
 
## Part 2
The second part of the assignment has the same goal as the first one, i.e. the estimation of the unknown parameters. The difference between the two tasks is that now we use real time (on-line) techniques, namely, **Gradient Method** and **Lyapunov Method** (Both Parallel and Series-Parallel models are used). Both methods are applied to a scalar system  (exercise 1 & 2) and the Lyapunov method is also applied to a second-order system (exercise 3).

## Project
The last part of the course's assignment concerns the analysis and recognition of an unknown linear black-box system, which means that the order of the system is unknown. In the first place, we examine if the basic requirements of linearity are met, i.e. homogeneity and additivity. After that, to meet our objective we use the Least Squares method (offline) and for various combinations of input-output orders we consider the minimum error.
